# Code Cleanup

This document describes the code cleanup and standardization efforts performed in the Dana AI platform.

## Removed Test Files

The following test files have been removed from the codebase:

- `add_test_knowledge_file.py`
- `add_knowledge_test_data.py`
- `check_api_protection.py`
- `check_config.py`
- `check_cookie_config.py`
- `check_dependencies.py`
- `check_email_endpoints.py`
- `check_integration_endpoint.py`
- `check_integration_imports.py`
- `check_pesapal_integration.py`
- `debug_auth.py`
- `debug_endpoint.py`
- `debug_routes.py`
- `debug_token.py`
- `add_sample_knowledge.py`
- `create_sample_docx.py`

## Deprecated Fix Scripts

The following fix scripts have been deprecated and removed as they have been replaced by a more systematic migration framework:

- `direct_add_knowledge_route.py`
- `direct_add_knowledge_tags.py`
- `direct_notifications.py`
- `direct_standard_email_fix.py`
- `direct_standard_integrations_fix.py`
- `disable_direct_email.py`
- `ensure_standard_email.py`
- `fix_all_routes.py`
- `fix_binary_upload.py`
- `fix_binary_upload_endpoint.py`
- `fix_direct_email_routes.py`
- `fix_email_integration.py`
- `fix_email_routes.py`
- `fix_knowledge_endpoints.py`
- `fix_knowledge_routes.py`

## Standardization Migrations

The new migration system provides a more structured approach to code changes:

1. **Centralized Registration**: Blueprint registration is now centralized in the migration system.
2. **Deprecation Notices**: Files that are kept for reference have clear deprecation notices.
3. **Standardized Integrations**: All integrations now follow a standard template pattern.
4. **Systematic Updates**: Main application code is updated systematically through migrations.

## Backup System

Before removing files, the system creates backups:

- All removed files are backed up in `backups/test_files_TIMESTAMP/`
- A documentation file `REMOVED_FILES.md` is created in the backup directory
- The backup directories are kept for reference in case restored files are needed

## Running Migrations

To run standardization migrations:
```
python apply_standardization.py
```

To run code cleanup migrations:
```
python run_code_cleanup.py
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Continue standardizing remaining integration modules**
2. **Add more migrations for database schema standardization**
3. **Document all deprecation patterns with clear migration paths**
4. **Fully adopt the migration framework for all system changes**
