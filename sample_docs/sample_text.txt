# Dana AI Platform Knowledge Base

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the Dana AI Platform's knowledge base system. The Dana AI Platform is a comprehensive solution for social media management, customer interaction, and business automation.

## Knowledge Base Features

1. **File Support**
   - PDF documents
   - Word documents (.docx)
   - Plain text files
   - Rich text content

2. **Search Capabilities**
   - Full-text search across all documents
   - Metadata-based filtering
   - Category and tag-based organization
   - Relevance scoring

3. **Integration Capabilities**
   - API access to knowledge content
   - Webhook notifications for content updates
   - Supabase database integration
   - Third-party system connections

## Use Cases

### Customer Support Automation
The knowledge base can be integrated with the conversation system to provide automatic responses based on stored knowledge, improving response times and consistency.

### Sales Enablement
Sales teams can access product information, pricing details, and competitive analysis through the knowledge base integration with messaging platforms.

### Internal Documentation
Organizations can maintain internal documentation and procedures that are easily searchable and accessible to authorized team members.

## Technical Implementation

The knowledge base system uses a combination of:
- File parsing utilities for content extraction
- Vector embeddings for semantic search
- Metadata indexing for fast filtering
- Role-based access control for security

## Integration Example

```
// Example of integrating the knowledge base with a chatbot
async function handleCustomerQuery(query) {
  // Search the knowledge base for relevant information
  const results = await knowledgeBase.search(query);
  
  if (results.length > 0) {
    // Use the top result to inform the response
    return generateResponse(query, results[0]);
  } else {
    // Fall back to default response if no knowledge is found
    return getDefaultResponse(query);
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

- All knowledge base content is isolated by user account
- Row-level security ensures data separation
- Authentication is required for all knowledge base operations
- Audit logging tracks all content access and modifications
