# Implementation Plan for Dana AI Platform

## 1. Fix Database Integration Configuration

The error logs show that the "integrations_config" table doesn't exist, but our models are trying to use it. We need to:

1. Create the correct table in the database (it should be "integration_configs" based on models_db.py)
2. Update any code that's trying to access "integrations_config" to use "integration_configs" instead
3. Fix the trigger function that's causing SQL errors

## 2. Setup Supabase Storage for Knowledge Files

Currently, knowledge files are stored directly in the database, but we want to transition to Supabase Storage:

1. Create a Supabase Storage bucket named "knowledge-files"
2. Modify the knowledge.py endpoints to handle uploading to Supabase Storage
3. Update the frontend KnowledgeBase component to use the new storage system

## 3. Fix Row Level Security Policies

The RLS policies are failing to apply correctly:

1. Review and fix the SQL policy creation in utils/supabase_rls.py
2. Ensure tables have the proper RLS policies for security

## 4. Enhance Slack Integration

The Slack integration is implemented, but we need to ensure it's properly connected to the database:

1. Create an integration configuration UI for Slack
2. Store Slack configuration in the database rather than environment variables
3. Implement proper OAuth flow for Slack authentication

## 5. Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Fix Database Schema

1. Create the missing "integration_configs" table if it doesn't exist
2. Update references from "integrations_config" to "integration_configs"

### Step 2: Create Supabase Storage Bucket

1. Fix permission issues with the storage bucket creation
2. Create the "knowledge-files" bucket
3. Set up appropriate RLS policies for the bucket

### Step 3: Update Knowledge Base Code

1. Modify the file upload endpoint to store files in Supabase Storage
2. Update the frontend to work with Storage URLs instead of base64 data

### Step 4: Enhance Integrations UI

1. Implement a proper integration configuration interface
2. Connect the UI to the backend APIs for managing integrations
