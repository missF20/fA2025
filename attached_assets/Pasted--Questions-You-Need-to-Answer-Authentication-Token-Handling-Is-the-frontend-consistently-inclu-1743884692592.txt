✅ Questions You Need to Answer
🔐 Authentication & Token Handling
Is the frontend consistently including the JWT token in all requests (especially file uploads)?

What method is being used to pass the token? (Authorization header, cookie, URL param?)

Does the backend expect a specific token format (e.g. Bearer token)? Is that aligned with how the frontend sends it?

Are the tokens expired, malformed, or signed with the wrong secret?

Is get_current_user() function extracting the token correctly from the request?

🌐 API Endpoint Conflicts
Are there duplicate routes that handle similar functionality (especially for file uploads)?

Is the frontend pointing to the correct path now that you’ve restructured the endpoints?

Is routing handled using Flask Blueprints, and are they being registered cleanly with no overlap or double-binding?

⚙️ Integration Failures
Are all external integrations (Shopify, email, Pesapal) correctly configured in the environment variables?

Are the API keys present, valid, and being passed in headers or requests where needed?

Is there logging around integration errors that can show which step is failing (e.g., connection, auth, payload validation)?

🔐 Supabase / RLS Issues
Are Row Level Security (RLS) policies too restrictive? Do they block legitimate queries or writes from your app?

Are there any conflicting or duplicate policies being applied (as the logs suggest)?

Have all roles been tested for the correct permissions (authenticated, anon, service roles)?

📛 Error Logging & Debugging
Are you using structured logging to track each API call and error precisely?

Do you log the full stack trace for 500 errors?

Can you isolate whether errors are happening before or after authentication in the backend?

💥 General Structure & Deployment
Are all API routes mounted and exposed properly after restructuring?

Are you using CORS middleware correctly in the backend?

Have you tested all endpoints using Postman or curl to simulate frontend behavior?
