The issue you're encountering in the knowledge base file upload process seems to be caused by a mismatch between the **column names** used in your SQL queries and the actual column names in your **database schema**. Let me break down the problem and outline the steps you can take to fix it:

### Issue Breakdown:
1. **Frontend Behavior:**
   - The frontend attempts to upload the file using **binary upload**, which fails. It then falls back to the **standard upload**, which also fails. This suggests that the file upload process is encountering errors either in the way data is being sent or how the backend handles it.
   
2. **Backend Behavior:**
   - The backend attempts to insert data into the `knowledge_files` table using incorrect column names in SQL queries. This is likely causing SQL errors or improper handling of the file data.
   - The **API** uses `file_name` and `metadata` in SQL queries, but your **database schema** uses `filename` and `binary_data` instead. This mismatch prevents the file data from being inserted correctly into the database.

### **Error Message:**
- **"Binary upload failed, falling back to standard upload..."**
- **"All upload methods failed."**
- **Errors related to fetching tags and categories**: This could be a result of the incorrect handling of metadata or mismatched column names.

### **Key Problem Areas:**
1. **Incorrect Column Names in SQL Queries:**
   - The **SQL queries** in the backend files (`routes/knowledge.py` and `routes/knowledge_binary.py`) use the wrong column names that don't match the actual database schema.
   - For example:
     - **File name:** `file_name` in the query vs. `filename` in the database.
     - **Metadata:** `metadata` in the query vs. `binary_data` in the database.

### **Critical Code in `routes/knowledge.py`:**
The problematic query in your `routes/knowledge.py` file is:
```python
insert_sql = """
INSERT INTO knowledge_files 
(user_id, file_name, file_type, file_size, content, created_at, updated_at, category, tags, metadata) 
VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s)
RETURNING id, user_id, file_name, file_type, file_size, created_at, updated_at, category, tags, metadata
"""
```
### The Corrected Version Should Be:
```python
insert_sql = """
INSERT INTO knowledge_files 
(user_id, filename, file_type, file_size, content, created_at, updated_at, category, tags, binary_data) 
VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s)
RETURNING id, user_id, filename, file_type, file_size, created_at, updated_at, category, tags, binary_data
"""
```

### **Action Steps to Fix the Issue:**

1. **Update the Backend SQL Queries:**
   - **Change** `file_name` to `filename` and `metadata` to `binary_data` in all the SQL queries where you're inserting or querying from the `knowledge_files` table.
   - Update both `routes/knowledge.py` and `routes/knowledge_binary.py` to use the correct column names (`filename` and `binary_data`).
   
   For example, in `routes/knowledge_binary.py`, if you have similar SQL queries, change them to:
   ```python
   insert_sql = """
   INSERT INTO knowledge_files 
   (user_id, filename, file_type, file_size, content, created_at, updated_at, category, tags, binary_data) 
   VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s)
   RETURNING id, user_id, filename, file_type, file_size, created_at, updated_at, category, tags, binary_data
   """
   ```

2. **Frontend Code Adjustments:**
   - Ensure that the frontend is **correctly handling the response data structure** with the updated column names (`filename` and `binary_data`).
   - The frontend should parse the returned data from the backend and expect `filename` and `binary_data` (instead of `file_name` and `metadata`).

   For example, if your frontend is expecting `file_name` in the response:
   ```javascript
   // Change to match the updated backend structure
   const fileName = response.filename;  // Use `filename` instead of `file_name`
   const binaryData = response.binary_data;  // Use `binary_data` instead of `metadata`
   ```

3. **Ensure Proper Error Handling in Backend:**
   - Since the log mentions that all upload methods failed, ensure your backend is **properly handling failures** and sending useful error messages to the frontend. This will help users understand what went wrong and help you debug issues faster.

   For example:
   ```python
   try:
       # Attempt to insert into the database
       cursor.execute(insert_sql, values)
       connection.commit()
   except Exception as e:
       return jsonify({'error': 'File upload failed', 'message': str(e)}), 500
   ```

4. **Check and Fix File Parsing Logic:**
   - In your `utils/file_parser.py` file, verify that the **PDF parsing** logic is working as expected and that the file content is correctly extracted and saved into the database. This might involve making sure that the file is read as binary and then inserted as `binary_data`.

   For example:
   ```python
   with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
       binary_content = f.read()
       # Ensure this binary content is passed as `binary_data`
   ```

5. **Test the Upload Process:**
   - After implementing these changes, test the upload process thoroughly. Upload different types of files (PDFs, images, etc.) and check if the upload is successful and the files are saved correctly in the database.
   - Verify that the frontend displays the correct status (e.g., "upload successful" or "upload failed" with a meaningful error message).

### **Summary of Fixes:**
1. **Update SQL queries** in both `routes/knowledge.py` and `routes/knowledge_binary.py` to use `filename` and `binary_data` instead of `file_name` and `metadata`.
2. **Ensure the frontend handles** the updated data structure (`filename` and `binary_data`).
3. **Improve error handling** in both the backend and frontend to provide useful feedback during the upload process.
4. **Verify file parsing** logic to ensure that binary content is correctly read and saved.

Once these fixes are applied, the file upload process should work correctly, and youâ€™ll avoid the errors caused by column name mismatches. Let me know if you need further assistance with the implementation or testing!
