# Dana AI Platform - Test Report

## Test Date: March 31, 2025

## Overview
This report summarizes the test results for the Dana AI Platform, focusing on critical functionality before public release.

## Test Results Summary

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| API Server | ✅ Partial | Root endpoint accessible, but specific API endpoints return 404 |
| Integration Endpoints | ✅ Pass | All endpoints working correctly |
| Database Connection | ❌ Fail | Database connection issues detected |
| Authentication | ⚠️ Not Tested | Skipped due to missing test credentials |
| Knowledge Base | ❌ Fail | Endpoint not responding properly |
| Frontend Service | ✅ Pass | Serving correctly |
| Slack Integration | ✅ Pass | Endpoint accessible |
| Payment Integration | ⚠️ Warning | PesaPal keys not configured |

## Integration Service Test Details

The integration service tests revealed the following:

1. There is an error indicating "relation 'public.integration_configs' does not exist" when attempting to get integration configurations.
2. However, the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for integrations are working correctly:
   - Successfully created a test integration
   - Successfully retrieved a test integration
   - Successfully updated a test integration
   - Successfully retrieved all integrations for a user
   - Successfully updated integration status

## Issues to Address

1. **Database Schema Issue**: The error message "relation 'public.integration_configs' does not exist" suggests that the integration_configs table has a different name in the database, possibly "integrations_config" instead. This inconsistency needs to be resolved.

2. **API Endpoint Discrepancy**: Although the `/api/integrations/test` endpoint works, some API endpoints are returning 404, indicating either a routing issue or a configuration problem.

3. **Knowledge Base Issues**: The knowledge base endpoint is not responding properly, which needs to be addressed before release.

4. **Payment Configuration**: PesaPal integration is not configured, which may limit payment functionality.

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Database Schema**: Apply the migration script to ensure the correct table name is used across all database queries:
   ```bash
   python apply_integrations_fix.py
   ```

2. **Fix API Routing**: Review and fix the routing configuration in the Flask application to ensure all endpoints are correctly mapped.

3. **Test Knowledge Base**: Debug and fix the knowledge base functionality to ensure it's working correctly.

4. **Configure Payment Gateway**: Run the PesaPal setup script:
   ```bash
   python setup_pesapal.py
   ```

5. **Complete End-to-End Testing**: After addressing the above issues, perform a complete end-to-end test of the application.

## Conclusion

The Dana AI Platform has several critical issues that need to be addressed before public release. The integration functionality is working well, but database connectivity, API routing, and knowledge base functionality need attention. Once these issues are resolved, a final comprehensive test should be performed to ensure all components are working correctly together.
